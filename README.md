# hello-world
My first repository

Hi Everyone,

I'm looking to make a mid-career change. I have a pretty solid understanding of logic (as a whole) and relational
data bases, so I'm expecting to pick this up quickly. I'm really looking forward to applying some of my ideas to
professional basketball data analysis, stand up comedy, and comics. Maybe some pop culture and film thrown in.

I'm going to learn front-end and back-end development in the effort to be a full stack developer. I'm going to start with
Ruby, build with Rails and transition to Python as well. From a UX standpoint, I like clean, minimalist design that is fast.
I used to do newspaper and print layout when I was in college, so I have a practical knowledge of design and typography, but
hopefully I can put all of these interests together.

Thanks!
